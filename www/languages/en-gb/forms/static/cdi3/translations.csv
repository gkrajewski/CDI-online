longText;In this questionnaire we ask parents (or other guardians) of English-speaking 3-year-olds to report the language skills of their children. In the first part, we will ask you to read a list of words and mark those that you have heard from your child. If your child already combines words into sentences, in the next part we will ask you some questions about those utterances. If you decide you do not want to share your answers with us before submitting the questionnaire, simply close your browser. If you change your mind afterwards, just let us know. You can do this without giving any explanation.;start;

longText;"In this section we will ask you to read a list of words and mark those that you have heard from your child. Please note that children understand more words than they use in speech. This part is only about the words that the child spontaneously says, not the words the child is able to repeat. If your child uses a slightly different form, e.g. says ‘veggie’ for ‘vegetable’ please still mark the word ‘vegetable’. Do the same if your child pronounces a word differently (e.g., ‘deir’ instead of ‘their’). Similarly, if there is a different term in the family than the one given in the questionnaire, please mark the appropriate word and add the accurate term in the comment box. You may also use this field to share any other comments.";word;
warning;NOTE: This questionnaire contains only a sample of the words your child may use. Your child is sure to know many other words that are not on this list. They probably also do not know all the words that are on the list. Please do not worry about this.;word;

instr;"Below you will find a list of questions about how your child uses language. While answering them, please keep in mind that we are asking about things that may appear at different ages, and that children develop at different rates. It is perfectly fine if you answer all of these questions in the negative. Also, please do not worry if your child makes mistakes. For example, if we ask whether your child uses words ending in “-est”, please answer in the affirmative if your child says, for example, “goodest”.";abstract;
